            <h2>Prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes</h2>
            <p><strong>Prediabetes and type 2 diabetes</strong> often don’t have any symptoms. (<strong>Type 1 diabetes</strong> is different—symptoms can develop quickly and can be severe.)</p>
            <p>That’s why people with any risk factors are urged to ask their doctor if they should be screened. <strong>Being screened means getting tested when you don’t have any symptoms.</strong></p>
            <h2>Type 1 diabetes</h2>
            <p><strong>Catching prediabetes early</strong> can help people prevent or delay type 2 diabetes. Finding out they have type 2 diabetes—and taking action—can help people prevent or delay serious health complications.</p>
            <p><strong>Getting tested is simple and quick.</strong> Your blood will be drawn at your doctor’s office or at a clinic so your blood sugar can be tested. Results are usually available quickly.</p>

                <h3>About Our Prediction</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>Online diabetes prediction tools are not diagnostic tests. They cannot definitively determine whether you have diabetes or whether you will develop it. Only a healthcare professional can make an accurate diagnosis through clinical tests.</p>
                <p>These tools often rely on general algorithms and may not take into account individual factors, such as family history, genetic predisposition, or more subtle health indicators. They can sometimes provide misleading results, either overestimating or underestimating the risk.</p>
                <p>While online diabetes prediction tools can be a useful starting point to understand your potential risk, they should not be relied upon solely. It’s always important to consult with a healthcare professional for a thorough diagnosis and personalized advice. Use these tools with caution and prioritize professional medical advice for any health concerns.</p>

                <p>If the result concerns you, schedule an appointment with a doctor. They can perform a more accurate diagnosis using blood tests (like fasting blood sugar, HbA1c, or an oral glucose tolerance test).</p>
                <p>Review your lifestyle habits, including your diet, exercise routine, and stress levels. If necessary, your doctor may recommend lifestyle changes or additional tests to assess your risk of diabetes more accurately.</p>
